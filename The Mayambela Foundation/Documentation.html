               Do you know what that means, is say that in some house holds they will went to bed with empty stomach.<br><br>
              <p>Mark Mayambela and his little brother Mihlali Mayambela decided to open they hearts by give back to the community offering groceries to the families who don't have much, 
                  That inspired Ayanda Patosi to give a helping also by buying school shoes for children of a primary school.
