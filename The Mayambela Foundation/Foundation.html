                               They received food parcels from a joint venture between the Mayambela Foundation & and a close friend to the foundation Ayanda Potasi, Khayelitsha TV and Baphumelele children's Home.
                               They also took part in different activities including a gender-based violence awareness campaign,

                                This is how Mark Mayambela as a football star is trying to plough back because he understands how it is to be hungry and coming from the background such as these children because he grew up in Khayalitsha.
                                He wants to assist in the journeyof these children because he was privileged enough to play football which ultimately changed his lifestyle.

                                I was once in my life where I had nothing. But it is true that if you work hard with what you have or been blessed at the end of the day the result will be worthwhile.
                                We are here not only so share our journey but to inspire and give you hope. If Mayambela who was born and grew in Khayelitsha van achieve what he has achieved, definitely there will be nothing stopping to achieve what you want to achieve as well.

                                Mayambela urged the children to be that first person that can change their different circumstances at home and not to forget to show love "because love is the most important thing you can give to any human being".

                                Dr Rethabile Sonibare, project manager for the Baphumelele Social Behavior Change Programme and founder of Molo Mhlaba School, assured the childrenthat<strong>"each one of them matters"</strong>

                               Most of the beneficiaries here are the heads of their households and they are still very young to play such a big role but due to life circumstance they ended up playing those roles.
                               Since we celebrate youth we call them in and also try to help them where we can. In partnership with Baphumelele, which we provide with scholarships, bursaries and anything to do with youth empowerment.
